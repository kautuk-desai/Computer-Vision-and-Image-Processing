# Computer-Vision-and-Image-Processing
CSE 473/573 course on Computer Vision and Image Processing

Homework 1 - Spatial Pyramid Matching for Scene Classification
Given an image, write a program to determine where it was taken. Representation is based on bags of visual words and then use spatial pyramid matching for classifying the scene categories.

Homework 2 - Scale-space Blob Detection
The goal of the assigment is to implement Laplacian blob detector. Also, implement Difference-of-Gaussian pyramid to detect the blobs.
